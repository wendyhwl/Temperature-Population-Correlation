Simon Fraser University CMPT353

## Description
### Objective
With the given data set, determine if there is any correlation between population density and temperature.

### Outcome
The below plot shows the average maximum temperature against population density. Here we can see that the points are all over the place; thus, the result shows no correlation relationship between the two variables.
